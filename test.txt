1. Cannot add egde if only one node is present
2. multiple edge not possible (adjust link cost)
3. check each and every thing user does in the system
    - open browser( user see buttons, and a canvas )
    - addNode ( node must come inside canvas, node should not overlap, node is made draggable-highlighted(but not overlap ), node is named uniquely, *node cannot be added if algorithm in running )
    - addEdge (no add if only one node, overwrite the edge cost if pre-existing node exist, cannot add if algo is running, )
