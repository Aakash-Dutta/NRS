# Tutorial

## Running the algorithms
 - Bellman Ford's Algorithm
 - Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Initiating the algorithm
 1. Algorithm Start Buttons
 2. Dealing with dialog box 

### Traversing the algorithm
- Step and Exit Animation (buttons)

- Also algorithm tracker table

- Explain the steps in graph
> Current Node, Neighbour node, present edge beign checked, already visited node

### Wrapping-up algorithm
- For bellman, cost are given along with nodes and source is highlighted

- For dijkstra the final path is highlighted

## Editing the Network

1. Add Node
2. Add Edge
3. Clear
